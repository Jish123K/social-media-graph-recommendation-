# social-media-graph-recommendation-
The goal of this project would be to build a model that can predict which users would be interested in following or interacting with certain content, based on their past behaviors on the platform. This could include factors such as which pages they have visited, which posts they have liked or commented on, and which other users they have interacted with.

To accomplish this, you could use a GNN pretrained model, such as the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) or Graph Attention Network (GAT). These models are designed to work with graph-structured data, such as social network graphs, and can learn to extract meaningful representations of nodes and edges in the graph.

You could use the pretrained model to train a recommendation model that takes in a user's graph structure as input and outputs a set of recommended pages, posts, or users for that user to follow or interact with. To train the model, you could use historical data on user behaviors and interactions on the platform, such as which pages they visited, which posts they liked or commented on, and which users they followed.

Once you have developed the model and integrated it into the social media platform, it could be used to provide personalized recommendations to users, helping to improve user engagement and retention on the platform. Additionally, it could help to increase the visibility of content and promote connections between users with similar interests.
